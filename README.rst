simple reverse polish notation parser to learn how to write parsers.


Description
===========

This reverse polish notation (RPN) parser parses RPN strings in Python and returns the calculated value.
It also provides a basic shell and command line interface.
Though it is basically a project for me to play a little bit around you might find it usefull or also want to hack around.

Note
====

It has been highly inspired by the great example of (Learn you some Erlang)[http://learnyousomeerlang.com/functionally-solving-problems#rpn-calculator] and secondly by (pyrpn)[https://github.com/archman/pyrpn].

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 2.5.7. For details and usage
